# Instructions:

    1. Unzip folder containing files and make sure your envirnment can compile python.
    
    2. Test merge sort and insert sort by typing the command "python insertsort.py" or "python mergesort.py", this command will create a new .txt file in the directory.
    
    3. Open the new .txt file to see the sorted arrays.
    
    4. Test the insert time and merge time by typing the command used in step 2 but with the Time.py files, "python insertTime.py" or "python mergeTime.py".
    
    5. The command in step 4 will print the n value and the time. If you wish to change the range values you can change the values in the array 'n' in both insertTime.py and mergeTime.py files. They are currently fitted so each output is not too slow(specifically the insert).
